# Tobermory-Day-5
today we only went to emmett lake. We went there from 10am-3pm to go fishing. We first boated around for 2 hours catching no fish. After that we ate lunch then we went fishing again. This time we were lucky we first got three fish on all our fishing rods. 2 escaped, 1 we captured and cooked it for a meal at 4pm. Then we chased around 10 bass then we got a 4 POUND BASS on one of the fishing rods. We first made sure we still had it on the line. Then i took the rod and reeled in slowly. After about 10 min we finally caught the fish. It flopped around for a long time trying to get into the water. While my dad was trying to take the hook out it bit him. And only after 30 min of hearing the fish nearly escaping the bucket it stopped flopping. Then we tried to catch fish for 1 more hour then we left. Overall we had a good time that day at emmett lake.
