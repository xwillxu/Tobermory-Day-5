# Tobermory-Day-5
today we only went to emmett lake. We went there from 10am-3pm to go fishing. We first boated around for 2 hours catching no fish. After that we ate lunch then we went fishing again. This time we were lucky we first got three fish on all our fishing rods. 2 escaped, 1 we captured and cooked it for a meal at 4pm. Then we chased around 10 bass then we got a 4 POUND BASS on one of the fishing rods. We first made sure we still had it on the line. Then i took the rod and reeled in slowly. After about 10 min we finally caught the fish. It flopped around for a long time trying to get into the water.
